    // - generate a random integer for picking a piece r from the player's pieces vector
    // - set y1, x1 to r->getY(), r->getX()
    // - generate random integers y2 and x2 in range of [0, H) and [0, W) respectively
    //   [or better in the y, x range of the 4 neighboring cells around (y1, x1), note to
    //    handle jumpable cells, 2 or 3 cells away, as well for Tiger and Lion]
    // - call board's move(y1, x1, y2, x2)
    // - once a valid move is returned, print the from and to cell addresses 
    //   and exit this function
    // Note: it can happen that no valid move can be found despite repeated picks.
    //       For example, only a Rat remains alive at a corner of the board while 
    //       the two cells it may go have been occupied by a Cat and a Dog.
    //       In this case, the player must surrender (set the opponent as winner).
